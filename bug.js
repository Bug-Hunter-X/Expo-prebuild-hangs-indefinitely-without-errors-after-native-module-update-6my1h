While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  After making changes to my project's dependencies (specifically, updating a native module), running `expo prebuild` resulted in the build process hanging indefinitely without any error messages in the console. The process monitor showed that the `expo prebuild` process was still running but wasn't progressing. This occurred only on a specific machine.  On other development machines, the same codebase built successfully. This issue was particularly frustrating because there were no explicit errors to debug.
