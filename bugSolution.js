The problem was resolved by identifying and fixing conflicting node versions. The original machine had multiple Node.js installations, some installed via nvm and others through a system package manager.  This conflict interfered with `expo prebuild`.  The solution involved carefully uninstalling all previous Node.js versions and ensuring a clean installation, either through nvm or the system package manager (using only one). After creating a fresh, clean Node environment, I then reinstalled all dependencies and ran `expo prebuild`.   The command completed successfully without issues.  Verify your system's Node and npm/yarn versions to ensure consistency.
