# Expo prebuild hangs indefinitely after native module update

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `expo prebuild` command hangs indefinitely after updating native modules in an Expo project. The issue is particularly unusual because no error messages are reported in the console.  The problem appears to be machine-specific; the same codebase builds successfully on other development environments.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.

The `expo prebuild` command will hang indefinitely.  Note that no errors will be printed to the console.

## Solution

The solution involved identifying and addressing issues related to the machine's environment, specifically focusing on the machine's configuration and potential conflicts with the system's node installation.  Detailed steps are provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
